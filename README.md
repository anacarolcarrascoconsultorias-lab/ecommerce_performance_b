**Tools:** Google Sheets, Pivot Tables, KPI Scorecards, Data Visualization

## 📌 Overview

This dashboard analyzes **customer value concentration** in an e-commerce dataset, focusing on how revenue is distributed across customer segments.

Rather than looking at products or markets, this analysis answers a different business question:

> *Who actually drives revenue, and how concentrated is that dependency?*

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

The goal of this dashboard is to:

- Identify **high-value vs low-value customers**
- Measure how much revenue depends on a small subset of customers
- Highlight potential **revenue concentration risk**
- Support decisions related to retention, loyalty, and customer strategy

---

## 🧠 Methodology

Customers were segmented based on **total revenue contribution**:

- **High-Value Customers:** Customers with above-average total revenue
- **Low-Value Customers:** Customers with below-average total revenue

All calculations were performed using aggregated customer-level metrics derived from transactional data.

---

## 📊 Key KPIs

- **Total Customers:** 4,338  
- **High-Value Customers:** 1,668 (38.45%)  
- **Total Revenue:** $8.91M  
- **Revenue from High-Value Customers:** $7.80M (87.57%)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **38.45% of customers generate 87.57% of total revenue**
